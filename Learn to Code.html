      <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">I would initially recommend working through the first 8 or so chapters of Chris Pine&#039;s book, Learn to Program (<a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>). Chris Pine does an excellent job of explaining the fundamentals of how Ruby (and principally many other languages) is structured, without bombarding you with too many different methods (you&#039;ll see) that you&#039;re overwhelmed. 
         And I can&#039;t stress enough how important it is complete the challenges, they really help to cement your knowledge!

      <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">This next resource is one many of you will have heard of, and perhaps began visited - Codecademy (<a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby</a>). Codecademy is a brilliant tool for expanding your knowledge of syntax. Their tracks cover a variety of coding topics at quite a simple level, and is a good place to start introducing yourself to the wider picture.
         However I would advise against leaning on resources of this nature for too long as they do spoon-feed you answers rather than teaching you to solve problems for yourself!

      <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">Next up is RubyMonk (<a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://rubymonk.com/">https://rubymonk.com/</a>), with three tiers of difficulty, RubyMonk will build upon your established foundations of Ruby knowledge and expand them significantly.
         I experienced quite a noticeable step up in the difficulty in RubyMonk&#039;s end-of-chapter exercises, but it definitely got me into the shape necessary before beginning on my course.

      <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">As you may have noticed in some of RubyMonk&#039;s exercises you have to start looking further afield for the answers to your problems, this is a key part of a day in the life of a developer, googling!
         Thankfully, the Ruby community has incredibly well written and maintained documentation that you can view (<a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ruby-doc.org/">http://ruby-doc.org/</a>) for free. I can&#039;t stress enough how important it is when learning any language to read the documentation.

      <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">Part of the Learn Code The Hard Way series; it introduces some great industry best practices as well as some new topics you won&#039;t have seen before. Solid resource.</p>

   <p class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg">If you&#039;ve completed everything above, it&#039;s probably time to give Codewars a go (<a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.codewars.com/">http://www.codewars.com/</a>). Interactive challenges developed by developers for developers, increasing in difficulty as you rank up and gain reputation. Achieving my first 50 points on Codewars was probably the most significant and beneficial step in my first 6 months of learning, I highly recommend.
