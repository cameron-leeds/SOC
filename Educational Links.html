Code.org https://studio.code.org A series of puzzles that teach you the basic fundamentals of computer science. It looks kind of kid-y, but it teaches really important lessons. Try the Classic Maze puzzle first. CodeMonkey https://www.playcodemonkey.com Another cute game where you control a monkey getting bananas using code. This one is kind of nice because it teaches concepts without requiring you to learn a language. Code Yourself https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-programming

C

Learn it: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010

Used for: operating systems, drivers, security tools, compilers, low-level services, robotics

C is the godfather of all languages. It is very bare-bones, so you often spend a lot of time doing things like managing your own memory. It doesn't have classes, it doesn't have strings, and if you screw up with memory management you can crash your computer. It's the closest thing to binary that most programmers will touch. And while it's difficult to master, you can use it to do almost anything your computer is capable of. If you can master it, you will be employable forever.

C++

Learn it: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011

Used for: games, desktop applications, low-level services, robotics... freakin' everything

C++ is literally C, upgraded ("++" is shorthand for "add one to it"). C++ adds things like classes and generics to C, while still allowing you to manage your own memory and do other fun tricks with your computer. Lots and lots of applications are written with C++, as well as most console games.

C#

Learn it: https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295 http://www.asp.net/mvc

Used for: desktop applications, games

C# has gotten very popular in recent years with the release of the Unity game engine, but it's also used to make desktop apps. It's very similar to Java, both in terms of language structure, and the fact that it requires a special framework to run. C# applications developed with the Mono runtime can be run on most operating systems.

HTML

Learn it: http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

Used for: building webpages

HTML is technically a "markup language", which means you can't do any actual computation with it. Browsers and other programs interpret HTML files and display their contents. Vanilla HTML is actually pretty bare-bones. Most of the nice styling you see on the web is thanks to CSS, which browsers use to "decorate" HTML layouts.

Java

Learn it: http://www.wideskills.com/java-tutorial

Used for: Android apps, web servers and applications, desktop apps, education

Lots of people who go to school for programming end up learning Java at some point. It's an excellent language to learn on because it contains a lot of features of other languages (like typed variables, abstract classes, generics, anonymous functions, etc). Java applications developed on the Java Virtual Machine are also inherently multi-platform, which is great for games and other desktop applications.

Javascript

Learn it (browser): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript

Learn it (Node): http://nodeschool.io

Used for: almost everything nowadays

Traditionally, programmers used JS exclusively in the browser to make webpages do interesting things. However, with the advent of NodeJS, Javascript is used fairly often to run web servers, and sometimes even desktop applications.

Objective-C

Learn it: http://rypress.com/tutorials/objective-c/index

Used for: iOS applications

I like to call Obj-C "C++'s lobotomized cousin", but that's unfair. What it really is, is a way for Apple to entrench itself in the minds of talented programmers and take up space that would otherwise be used for more useful and universal languages. It's guaranteed market share, the language. But, if you want to make iPhone apps, you probably should learn it.

PHP

Learn it: http://www.hackingwithphp.com

Used for: web applications

Facebook's language of choice. Many programmers hate PHP, but it's still a very popular language because so many pieces of the internet were built with it (back before we had better languages).

Python

Learn it: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial

Used for: scripting, web applications, robotics

Python is also a great language to learn on. It's a little harder to transition from Python to other languages, but it's a very useful language by itself. It's very easy to read, which makes it a great language for making developer tools or just for writing your own automation scripts. There are also many web application frameworks written in Python, including the popular Django.

Edit: @ZombieEinstein tells me that Python has become the go-to language for organizations like NASA and iRobot for running higher-level logic on robots.


Ruby

Learn it: https://rubymonk.com/

Used for: scripting, web applications

One of the cooler things about Ruby is that it easily supports metaprogramming: writing programs that use other programs' code as input. That makes it really easy to re-use chunks of Ruby you've already written. Re-using old code is kind of like sex to a programmer. Ruby is also the language you use to write applications for Ruby-on-Rails, which is an extremely popular web app framework.

SQL

Learn it: http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book

Used for: working with databases

Some of the most popular databases (namely MySQL and pgSQL) use SQL to store and retrieve data. That's really the only thing it *can* do, but it's a very useful language to know if you're making websites.

So, if you don't feel like practicing by coming up with a whole new discrete calculus library, you should find an open source project and see if there's any bugs or features you can work on! Github https://github.com/search Github maintains the largest collection of open source projects. Pick one you like, click on Features, pick a bug, fork the repo (using this tutorial: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and get started! If you have a language preference, you can filter your search using "language:X" where X is your language. Volunteer at Mozilla https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/signup Contribute to the awesome Firefox browser! The Mozilla community is wonderful and very supportive. They have a slightly different setup for how to contribute, but they'll show you how to get set up. CodeTriage http://www.codetriage.com If you find you like bug stomping (to use a highly technical term), you can sign up for CodeTriage, which sends you a new bug to work on every day. Be a hero without doing all the searching!

Git is a version control system that's quickly become the standard for many programming industries. Version control systems basically allow you to save copies of your files at different points in time, and switch to different versions of those files when you need to. They also are great tools for collaborating with other programmers because they allow you to "merge" two copies of a file into one. Github Classes https://training.github.com/classes Github is a company that hosts git repositories for thousands of developers. They have a great tutorial on how to use Git. GitHug https://github.com/Gazler/githug If you're handy with the command line, githug is a cheeky little game that helps you learn Git fundamentals. Codecademy Learn Git https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git Another solid tutorial from Codecademy about Git.

"Notepad sucks. There's got to be a better way to do this."
You bet there is! You should use an IDE (stands for Integrated Development Environment). They're basically text editors with a bunch of awesome features, like code completion (where it detects what you're trying to write and offers to finish it for you), integrated compilers and interpreters, and quick access to all the documentation you need. Here's some of my favorites: C/C++/C# Visual Studio (Community Edition is free) - http://visualstudio.com Javascript WebStorm - https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm Java IntelliJ IDEA - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea Eclipse - http://eclipse.org Everything else Sublime Text - https://www.sublimetext.com (I use this as my default text editor. It's got a bunch of great themes and a *ton* of plugins that basically turn it into its own IDE)

 "What other stuff should I know about?"

Stack Overflow
http://www.stackoverflow.com

Stack Overflow is probably the single greatest resource for programmers ever. If you ever find yourself stuck on a problem, search on SO for it, because most likely someone there has solved it already. If not, you can post about it, and someone will probably help you out in a day or two.

Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net

Project Euler is a series of math problems that get progressively more difficult and complex, and you need to use code to solve them. When I'm learning a new language, or switching back to an old one after a long period of not using it, I usually do some Project Euler problems to polish my skills up.

The Art of The Command Line
https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line

The command line is one of the most powerful tools a programmer can know. This is a great text on how to learn the Linux (and Mac, for the most part) command line.

Women Who Code
https://www.womenwhocode.com

For all the ladies: Women Who Code hosts meetups in many major cities for women who are programmers or learning to program.

CoderDojo
https://coderdojo.com

Free programming clubs for kids all around the world.

Programming @ Meetup.com
http://computer-programming.meetup.com

Learning from other people is probably the best way to learn how to program. It helps keep you motivated, and it also means you have someone who you can ask questions. I know socializing is hard, but you won't regret it!
